<h2 id = "text-id">Hello World</h2> <!-- id must be unique -->
<html lang = "en">Hello World</h3> <!-- used to identify the language of the text -->
<h4 dir = "rtl">Hello World</h4> <!-- dir means direction of the text is from right-to-left-->

        https://image2.com 960w"
sizes = "(max-width: 480px) 240px,
        (max-width: 960px) 480px"> <!-- sizes is to know which size images to use at which media query | while srcset allows you to choose which images to use at different media query or screen resolution -->

<!-- LESSON 5.4 - RESPONSIVE PICTURE - changing image based on different viewport width -->
<picture>
<source media = "(min-width:600px)"

- BORDER | e.g. border: width(10px), style(solid), color(red) 
- PADDING | 4 values only = top,right,bottom then left | e.g. padding-top: 2rem;
TOP-WIDTH, RIGHT-WIDTH, BOTTOM-WIDTH, LEFT-WIDTH, WIDTH - use absolute or relative length unit or descriptive (solid,thin)| e.g. border-width, border-top-width,... you get what i mean
- BORDER | e.g. border-top-width: 1em; border-width: thin; 
- BORDER-WIDTH: if 1 value = all 4 sides, if 4 values = top,right,bottom then left
MAX, MIN - e.g. max-height, min-width
HEIGHT - as an absolute, a relative, or as auto. | e.g. body { height:15px; } | default is box-sizing:content-box, which refers the height of the content rather than the border, to fix, use border-box

.{block__{element}--{modifier}
.{block}--{modifier}
BLOCK(think of it as section)/(parent) - card, block
ELEMENT - inside of a block - image, paragraph, desc, item, link
MODIFIER - use them to change the appearance, state or behavior | can be reused - secondary,primary,active | example use case is button--active, what will happen to the button after clicked
HTML:
<body>
<div class = "card"> <!-- card is a block -- >
<img class = "card__picture" src = "#"> <!-- card__picture is an element -->
<h3 class = "card__title">Title</h3> <!-- card_title is an element -->

https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
step 1: click raw -> then save as 
step 2: move git-completion.bash.txt .git-completion.bash
step 3: okay wtf am i doing, im using windows and auto completion is already there 

// LESSON 2.6 - GIT HELP - uesful tool on how to use git
git help

// LESSON 3.1 - INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY
step 1: go to the project/folder first using cd
step 2: git init // initialize a project to use git, do this only once
step 3: ls -la // see the list 

// LESSON 3.3 - YOUR FIRST COMMIT - commit changes to the repository (github)
// step 1: create changes, what i did is create a file using echo "text" > text1.txt
// step 2: git add . // commit at the folder where you did git init not at the file where you edit
// step 3: git commit -m "Initial Commit" // -m is for message, make the message short, keep each line to less than 72 characters, write them in present tense, not paste tense (ex. fixes a bug not fixed a bug | or better yet just use: 'bugFix:' so we could search it easily)

// LESSON 3.5 - VIEW THE COMMIT LOG
git log // view those who committed
git help log 
git log -n 5 // only show the last 5 commits
git log --since=2021-07-15 // show commits sicne this date, you could also use --until and --author
git log --grep="Init" // grep means globally search for regular expression, in this specific example: it returns any commit that matches "Init"

// LESSON 4.1 - THREE TREES
// repository -> staging index -> working | this is top down

// workflow: you have a file.txt(working) -> you do git add . (staging index) -> you do git commit (repository)

// LESSON 5.1 - ADD FILES
git status // it'll let us know the status of things, if we needed to commit anything or if there are untracked files which isn't at the indexing stage yet
echo "content of text" file2.txt , to move this into idnexing stage specifically this file, type git add file2.txt
// if you have untracked files according to git status, any changes made to that file would not be tracked by the git
// to transfer from indexing stage to repository do git commit 


// LESSON 5.2 - EDIT FILES
// do a git status after editing files, then you could see that changes not staged for commit , this means we need to do a git add on it again, think of git add as the save

// LESSON 5.3 - VIEW CHANGES WITH git diff - only used to know the changes in working directory
// with git status we can know if there is changes in a tracked file, how to know the changes in this file? we use git diff  

// LESSON 5.4 - VIEW ONLY STAGED CHANGES - used to know changes that is in the indexing stage
// to do this type git diff --staged

// LESSON 5.5 - DELETE FILES
// if at working directory 
rm fileName

// if a tracked file (indexing stage)
rm fileName // equivalent to changes
git rm fileName // moving it into indexing stage after changes
git commit -m "" // committing these changes into repository

// LESSON 5.6 - MOVE AND RENAME FILES - these are synonymous 
// working directory 
step 1: rename files - git mv fileName newFileName // if you do git status it would be seperating the rename into two: deleted and added 
step 2: git rm and git add the renamed file to move them into indexing stage 

// tracked file (indexing stage)
step 1: rename files - git mv fileName newFileName

// moving file 
git mv fileName folder/fileName

// USING GIT
step 1: initialize a git with the folder/project you wanted to make a repository from: git init | then git add . to start tracking all of the content with that project
step 2: make some edit like remove,modify,add then stage them with: git rm, git mv, etc. | to know the status if a file is in working or stage, use git status 
step 3(optional) : look at edits or changes, if it's in working directory git diff, if it's in stage git diff --staged
step 4: commit and transfer them from indexing stage to repository: git commit 
step 5: view commits with: git log 

// LESSON 6.4 - STAGE AND COMMIT SHORTCUT - staging and committing in one command 
git commit -am "staging and committing in one go"

// LESSON 6.5 - VIEW A COMMIT 
// viewing a diff, like git diff but with specific commit no.
git show 1c1xasdf912 // this 1c1xa... is the commit no., you could get this in git log

// using color words instead of - and + for looking at the changes 
git show 1c1xas --color-words // this is much better choice if the changes you're looking for is an inline, you coudl also use this in git diff 

// LESSON 6.6 - COMPARING COMMITS 
git diff 1c16945..9dcff // 1c16945 is the first commit and i want to compare its changes with 9dcff
git diff 1c16945..HEAD // comparing 1c16945 with the latest commit 

// LESSON 6.7 - MULTILINE COMMIT MESSAGES
git commit -a // do not add m then click enter, bash would automatically open to your code editor where you could enter multiline comment 

// LESSON 6.8 - MAKE ATOMIC COMMITS - small commits | BEST PRACTICE - ALWAYS DO THIS, COMMIT ON EACH TASK YOU CREATE, EX. OF TASK TO MAKE THIS CLEAR: 1. REMOVE PARAGRAPH FROM GREEN WIDGET, 2. ADD PHOTO IN YELLOW WIDGETM 3. UPDATE PRICES ON GREEN WIDGET
// for example you have a lot files that is for commit, first two file is related to each other and the remaining files is not related, if you'd commit them all together in one it would be weird and confusing when someone came back to this version
// fix for problem above is through atomic commits, first is you only indexed stage those who are related files then commit them afterwards, then move on to the another set of file, index and commit them 

// LESSON 7.1 - UNDO CHANGES ON WORKING DIRECTORY 
git checkout -- fileName.html

// LESSON 7.2 - UNSTAGE FILES, convert them back to working directory 
git reset HEAD fileName.html

// LESSON 7.3 - AMEND COMMITS - only for most recent commit 
// after you have commited but you forgot something that you want to add in that commit / RECOMMIT, GENERATING NEW SHA
git commit --amend -m "amend commit" // you could also change the message with this, but remember only with latest commit

// lesson 7.4 - RETRIEVE OLD VERSION - WAY TO UNDO COMMITS, RETRIEVE THE OLD VERSION THEN MAKE NEW COMMIT (NOT SUGGESTED)
// step 1: git log, this is to know the SHA
// step 2: git show dfasd12, this is like the git diff for commits, look at the changes in that commit 
// step 3: git checkout dfasdfas123 -- explorers.html // retrieving commit with sha dfasd... on the current branch | -- means current branch | this would convert things into staging directory | if you're looking for a specific things , retirieve the sha before it, sha is created after commit
// step 4: you are now at the file before your specific change(one youre looking for) occurs

// LESSON 7.5 - REVERT A COMMIT - UNDO A COMMIT (BEST/ BETTERE VERSION COMPARED ABOVE)
git revert dfasdfas123 // better and easier way compared above | IT IS VERY EASY TO DO ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DID ATOMIC COMMITS SO MAKE SURE TO DO THAT

// LESSON 7.6 - REMOVE UNTRACKED FILES (FILES THAT HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED GIT ADD. ATLEAST ONCE OR THOSE THAT WAS UNDO FROM WORKING DIRECTORY )
// we can remove it by hand tho but we do everything at command line becuz using mouse is for noobs 
git clean -n // this would just provide warnings on what file would it remove, this does nothing else 
git clean -f // actually removing the untracked file 

// removign file when it's already in indexing stage 
step 1: git reset HEAD fileName.html 
step 2: git clean -f

// LESSON 8.1 - USING .GITIGNORE FILES 
// pattern matching(regex): * ? [aeiou] [0-9]
// negative expressions: *.php // ignore all files that end with .php
// ignore all files in a directory with a trailing slash: assets/videos/

// step 1: create .gitignore file then the content would be the files you'd like to ignore
// step 1 method 2: in bash type touch .gitignore
// example content for .gitignore
.DS_Store
*.zip // everything that ends with .zip
*.gz
assets/photoshop/
assets/videos/
!assets/videos/tour_*.mp4 // ! means except these files, do not ignore these 

// LESSON 8.2 - WHAT TO IGNORE 
- COMPILED SOURCE CODE 
- PACKAGES AND COMPRESSED FILES 
- LOGS AND DATABASES 
- OPERATING SYSTEM GENERATED FILES 
- USER UPLOADED ASSETS (IMAGES, PDFS, VIDEOS)
- try looking at github.com/github/gitignore to get more idea on what to ignore 

// LESSON 8.3 - GLOBALLY IGNORE FILES
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

// LESSON 8.4 - IGNORE TRACKED FILES - case where you just recently added to gitignore a file that you have been tracking 
step 1 : git rm --cached fileName.txt // this is the tracked file | cached wil remove it from repository while keeping the local copy safe 
step 2 : git add .gitignore 
step 3: git commit - m "Stop track changes"

// LESSON 9.1 - REFERENCE COMMITS 
tree-ish - directory containing files, or a commit, or a reference 

// show HEAD
git show HEAD

// access ancestor - or the one before it 
git show HEAD^ // access the parent | you could also use master^ , de14621^ or the SHA 
git show HEAD^^ // access the grandparent

// tree listing 
git help ls-tree to read the documentation 
git ls-tree HEAD // blob are files, trees are directory | this is to know what the files and folder there are during this commit 
git ls-tree HEAD assets // show every directory or file that has the word assets 
git ls-tree HEAD assets/ // show every file inside assets 

// LESSON 9.4 - FILTER THE COMMIT LOG 
git log -3 // only return the 3 recent commits 
git log --since=2021-07-16 // return commits starting 07 16
git log --until=2019-07-16 // return commits before 07-16 starts 
git log --author"Renz" // return where author is Renz 
git log --grep="Initial" // use regular expression or pattern matching, return anything that has Initial 
git log b44740..HEAD // start from commit with b44740 sha up to the head or most recent commit 

// LESSON 9.5 - FORMAT THE COMMIT LOG 
git log --stat // stats on changes on each commit 
git log --format=medium // medium is default, there is also short which provides less info,and also oneline,etc.
git log --oneline // reduce the size of SHA (i'm starting to like this one)

// LESSON 10.1 - BRANCHING 
- this is where you try new ideas, instead of doing it in master branch and if there's wrong you have to undo it 
- if good ideas came from branch then you can merge it into master branch (think of master branch as the original branch where everything is working fine)
- HEAD pointer always points the current commit you're in whether it be on master branch or just branch
- you could create a branch from a branch

// LESSON 10.2 - CREATING BRANCHES
git branch // see branch 
git branch new_feature // creating branch 
cat .git/HEAD // know where head poitns to 
git log --oneline // you could also do this to know where head points to 

// LESSON 10.3 - SWITCHING BRANCHES 
step 1: git checkout branch_name 
git branch // try and see that it's now pointing to different branch 

// LESSON 10.4 - CREATE AND SWITCH BRANCHES AT THE SAME TIME 
step 1: figure out first the branches: git branch 
step 2: git log --oneline to figure out where you're at 
step 3: go to the branch where'd you'd like to create a branch: git checkout brancName
step 4: git checkout -b newNew_branch // created and switched 

// LESSON 10.5 - SWITCH BRANCHES WITH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES 
// cannot swithc if changes in working directory conflict with another branch 
// can switch if changes in working directory could be applied without conflict, even though this is fine it is still not a good idea

// solution
1. commit changes to the current branch 
2. remove the changes, checkout the file again 
3. stash the changes 

// LESSON 10.6 - COMPARE BRANCHES - you could also compare remote branch and local branch 
git diff master..newBranch // compare differences with master branch with different branch 
git diff master..newBranch^ // compare master branch with the parent commit of the newBranch 

// find out which branch has been merged 
git branch --merged // it shows all of the commits in current branch is also in another branch
git branch --no-merged // opposite

// LESSON 10.7 - RENAME BRANCHES 
step 1: go to current branch : git checkout branch_name 
step 2: git branch -m new_title_of_branch 

// LESSON 10.8 - DELETE BRANCHES 
git branch -d branch_to_delete

// if there is commit that you're going to lose in a branch because it wasn't merged 
git branch -D branch_to_delete

// LESSON 10.9 - CONFIGURE COMMAND PROMPT
// ours is already configured since we could see what branch are we 

// LESSON 11.1 - RESET BRANCH: RESET TYPES - it's like undoing commits 
// make my project look like it did back then, move head pointer to a specific commit 
soft - moves head pointer, does not change staging index and working directory , git reset --soft <tree-ish>
mixed - moves head pointer, changes staging index to match repository, does not chagne working directory, git reset --mixed <tree-ish> | default choice 
hard - moves head pointer, changes staging to match repository, changes workign directory to match repository, git reset --hard <tree-ish>

Given: - A - B - C (master)
git reset --soft A and you will see B and C's stuff in green (staged and ready to commit) | changes it commits b and c would be left at indexing stage ready to be commited and if you commit it, it owuld be like merging a,b, and c
git reset --mixed A (or git reset A) and you will see B and C's stuff in red (unstaged and ready to be staged (green) and then committed) | almost the same with --soft except it's left in workign directory 
git reset --hard A and you will no longer see B and C's changes anywhere (will be as if they never existed) | 

// LESSON 11.2 - SOFT RESET 
- returns to an old state and leave code changes staged 
- useful for merging one or more commits
- similar to git commit --amend 
- previpous commits will be discarded 

step 1: git checkout -b reset_branch // create a reset branch
step 2: create some edit on some of the files and commit it into the reset_branch
step 3: edit some file again on some of the files and commit again into the reset_branch
step 4(optional): copy the sha of the most recent commit from: git log -2 --oneline
step 5: git reset --soft HEAD^ // reset back to the parent of head, but changes made in most recent commit(head) would not be removed, they would be at the indexing stage 
step 6(optional): git reset --soft e110a2f // this sha is for the most recent commit, if we do this, we just moved the head back to the most recent commit
step 7: after step 5, recommit and it would be like combining 2 commits squashed into one 

// LESSON 11.3 - MIXED RESET
- returns to an old state and leave code changes in working directory
- useful for reorganizing commits 
- previous commits will be discarded 

step 1: git checkout branch_to_work // go to the specific branch youll be working on 
step 2: edit some file and commit changes 
step 3: edit some files again and commit changes again 
step 3: git reset --mixed HEAD^ // changes made in most recent commit would be at the working directory and head would be pointing at head^, the only diff with soft is that here it is left in working directory 

// LESSON 11.4 - HARD RESET - instead of leaving the changes made in working directory/indexing stage, you completely remove them 
- returns to an old stage and leave code changes 
- permanently undo commits 
- previously commits and all changes would be discarded 

step 1: git checkout branch_to_work // go to the specific branch youll be working on 
step 2: edit some file and commit changes 
step 3: edit some files again and commit changes again 
step 3: git reset --hard HEAD^ // most recent commit or head would be completely deleted :(

// LESSON 12.1 - MERGE CODE 
- when everything you've been working on a branch seems all good, you now merge it into master branch (main/original branch)

step 1: git checkout master // go to branch where you want it to merge  
step 2: git merge --no-ff new_branch // merge new_branch into the current branch you're in 
step 3: git log --graph --all --oneline --decorate // you could now see that both new_branch and master points to the same commit 
step 4: git branch -d new_branch // since this new_branch is already merged, it's a good idea to delete them 

// LESSON 12.2 - FAST FORWARD MERGE VS TRUE MERGE 
true merge - merge has been made but the merged branch is still there | --no-ff
fast forward merge - everything has been merged into one line | this is the default, git merge , lesson 12.1 | i think this would cause headaches in the long run since you can't track if a feature has been added by this branch or not 

// undo merge: 
step 1: go to the branch you want 
git reset --hard HEAD^, example you merge it into master, you do this command at master not at any other branch


// LESSON 12.3 - MERGE CONFLICTS 
// merge occurs when there are two changes in the same line or set of lines in two different commits 
ex. 
step 1: branch 1 has: <span> git is great </span>  | note that these are already committed into these branches 
step 2: branch 2 has: <em> git is great </em>
step 3: now you merge them - but it produces error, name would be branch[merging], you could also see something weird on the file you've been merging where conflict occured and these are called conflict markers

3 ways to resolve merge 
1. abort merge 
2. resolve the conflict manually
3. use a merge tool 

1. git merge --abort // stop merging 
2. choose only from 1 branch which one you'll choose | if during merging, type this: git show --color-words to identify the differences between the merging conflict, make sure to remove the markers 
3. the instructor doesn't know how to do this since he do changes manually or he used gui tool

// LESSON 12.4 - STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CONFLICTS 
- keep liens short
- keep commits small and focused (make atomic commits)
- you must have the same preferences with collaborator : spaces,tabs,line returns 
- merge often also called as tracking, this is to reduce merge conflicts ? 

// LESSON 13.1 - SAVE CHANGES IN THE STASH - by default untracked files isn't included in stashes, altho you could include them just search on youtube 
stash is not part of the three trees, it's a special 4th area of git separate from others | think of it as a temporary save 

// example use case: you're modifying something in a specific branch and you're not ready to commit yet but then you wanted to visit to another branch, git will stop you because you haven't committed yet, what the solution? stash those uncommited edits
// stash
git stash save "string string string" // the one you're editing is now saved into string string string. now you can switch branches 

// LESSON 13.2 - VIEW STASHED CHANGES - stashed are uncommited edits 
git stash list // view stashes 
git stash show stash@{0} // view the first stash
git stash show -p stash@{0} // show changes like diff 
note: you could be at any branch and you could still view the stash list 

// LESSON 13.3 - RETRIEVE STASHED CHANGES 
step 1: figure out what branch you're gonna use it, git checkout branch 
step 2: git stash pop,, this would remove a single stash and apply it to the working directory of curent branch
step 2(method 2):  git stash pop stash@{0}, removing a single stash but you wanted something specific 
step 2(method 3): git stash apply, the stash wouldnt be removed but it would still be in working directory, this is useful if you wanted to apply same stash to multiple branches 

// LESSON 13.4 - DELETE STASHED CHANGES 
git stash drop stash@{0} // delete specific stash
git stash clear // delete every stash 

// LESSON 14.1 - LOCAL AND REMOTE REPOSITORIES 
// master (local master) -> origin/master (remote, master branch)
// putting local repository into remote repo is called push 
// master -> origin/master copies it (tracking branch for remote) -> push to remote server (still called master)
// fetch - when changes has been made on remote server but not on local repo and now we want to put those changes in local server/repo, it goes to origin/master but not on master, note that origin/master(think of diz is a branch) is diff from master 

// LESSON 14.2 - GITHUB 
// it is good practice to have the same name for local project and remote repository, github is the remote repository 

// LESSON 14.3 - ADD A REMOTE REPOSITORY 
// push an existing local repository from the command line 
git remote add origin https.github.com/easdfas // this command line can be seen when you create new repo in github, just find it | origin is name of the repo 

git remote // it tells you what remote repo you have, add -v to get more information with this remote 

// delete a remote repo 
git remote rm origin // origin is name of the repo 

// LESSON 14.3 - CREATEA A REMOTE BRANCH - putting your work into github, remember to do the step above first before doing this 
git push -u origin master // push to origin remote, master branch
// github mostly asks for email and password which is cumbersome if this owuld be done every single time, so just search on youtbe the fix for this  

// show remote branch 
git branch -r 

// show all branch including local and remote 
git branch -a 

// LESSON 14.4 - CLONE A REMOTE REPOSITORY 
// go to github, find the clone or download in the repo then copy the link given 
git clone https.github.com/easdfas // just one version is created, creating exact copy of the original file 
git clone https.github.com/easdfas renz_version // this owuld create two files, the file we cloned which contains all of the orignal files and directory and the renz_version which contains only the master branch 

// UNFINISHED - LESSON 14.5 - TRACKIGN REMOTE BRANCH 

// LESSON 15.1 - PUSH CHANGES TO A REMOTE REPOSITORY 
step 1: create some changes yet into local copy | note than origin/master is the tracking branch for the remote branch, it's not the real remote branch 
step 2: git push // you don't need to specify origin master anymore since you have tracking branch, you just need git push  
step 2: git push origin master // this means push to origin(remote repo) the changes made from the master(local repo)

// LESSON 15.2 - FETCH CHANGES FROM A REMOTE REPOSITORY 
git fetch origin // fetch from origin(remote repo)
// note that we still have to merge this fetch into the local repo or master branch if you want | fetch just give you the newly added commits from remote repo, it doesnt merge it automaticalyl to your master branch 

// using fetch - to get information, there's no harm in doing this since it doesn't merge into anything 
fetch before start your day
fetch before you push 
fetch before you go offline 
fetch often 

// LESSON 15.3 - MERGE IN FETCHED CHANGES 
// after git fetch 
git merge origin/master // this is a fast forward merge 

// one command for git fetch + git merge 
git pull // use this cautiously, always remember that this is a two step process combination, git fetch is very useful so don't forget that 

// LESSON 15.4 - CHECKOUT REMOTE BRANCHES 
git branch -r // check only remote branches 
git branch -a // check local and remote branches 

// we can't checkout remote branches, but we can make a branch out of that remote branch, make edits on that new branch and then push it to remote afterwards 
step 1: git branch branch origin/branch // creating the same name of the branch 
step 2: git checkout branch // now make your edits in here 

// LESSON 15.5 - PUSH TO AN UPDATED REMOTE BRANCH
step 1: perform a fetch then merge into it 
step 2: push 

// LESSON 15.6 - DELETE A REMOTE BANCH 
- useful when a feature branch is complete and merged 
git push origin :branch // 1st way to delete the remote branch "branch"
git push origin --delete branch // 2nd way 

// LESSON 15.7 - ENABLE COLLABORATION 
1st - add collaborators to your projects
- go to github website, settings -> collaborators -> add name of collaborator | diff from open source project 

2nd - join an open source project 
- on a repo, click fork 
- look at issues, pull request, make sure someone isn't working on the change you're thinking in mind 

// LESSON 15.8 - COLLABORATION WORKFLOW 
// ongoing project , repo has been set upped, and we'll start working on a feature
- git checkout master 
- git fetch 
- git merge origin/master // merging on your master branch 
- git checkout -b newBranch // create newbranch then switch into it 
- create some edits 
- git add file.html 
- git commit -m "message"
- git fetch // maybe there has been commits that has been made
- git push -u origin newBranch  

// i sent an email to other people, my work is done and now it's her turn, given that she already has the repo set up, this would be her routine: 
- git checkout master
- git fetch 
- git merge origin/master // her master branch is now up to date 
- git checkout -b branch origin/branch // creating a branch out of remote branch, this is tracking the branch that i pushed so she can do some edits on the feature branch i created 
- git log // now she's looking at the changes i made 
- git show 832asdf // 832 is a sha, looking at each commits 
- she made some edits 
- git commit -am " add tour selector on this branch"
- git fetch // she does this to make sure no new edits have been done on new repo 
- git push // everything's good, she pushed her edits 

// my work 
- git fetch 
- git log -p branch..origin/branch // like doing a diff in 2 branch, i wanted to see her edits and compare them to my edit 
- git merge origin/branch // after everythings good i now merge her creation with mine 
- git checkout master // since she already pushed her edits in the remote repo, i'll now pull what she have done into my local repo 
- git fetch // check if anything has come new
- git merge origin/master // i'll only do this if there are something new i got from fetch  
- git merge branch // since everything's already good ill now merge my feature branch into master
- git push // now the new feature is on the remote server 
// now the new feature is on the remote server 


// LESSON X.1 - BASIC COMMAND LINE
ls - list of file and directories
dir - list of directories/folder
cd - change directory
cd .. - change directory backwards
mkdir projectName - create folder
echo "See ya later alligator" > file1.txt - create content with echo then create file
rm - delete file
touch - create file 

// LESSON X.3 - GIT UNINIT
rm -rf .git

// LESSON X.4 - CREATING ALIAS 
git config --global alias.st "status" // now instead of typing status you just type st 
// this would be very useful for log --graph --decorate --oneline --all | create an alias of logg for this 

// CONCLUSION: LESSON X.4 - USING GIT
step 0: udnerstand working directory -> indexing stage -> commit | to start tracking files you need to do git add , this git add is also used to convert working directory to indexing stage | everytime you do edits, you need to put it into indexing stage again 
step 1: initialize a git with the folder/project you wanted to make a repository from: git init | 
step 2: create a gitignore with touch .gitignore | add files you wanted to ignore in .gitignore then after all is done do git add . to start trackign them and now commit them with message "initial commit"
step 3: creating a remote repo in github:  git remote add origin https.github/linkoffile -> git push -u origin master 
step 4: have a look if you're at the correct branch | create branch and switch : git checkout -b new_branch | swithc branch: git checkout master
step 5: make some edit like remove,modify,add then stage them,  git rm, git mv, etc. | to know the status if a file is in working or stage, use git status 
step 6(optional) : look at edits or changes, if it's in working directory git diff, if it's in stage git diff --staged | use --color-words if you're looking only at inline changes
step 7: stage then commit them at the same time with: git commit -am "message" | to do them individually use git add for staging and git commit for committing | make sure to use atomic commits as it is very useful
step 8: view commits with: git log | to compare commits use git diff 1casdfa...1231asdf
step 9(optional) : undo commit: git revert SHA123 | unstage file: git reset HEAD | undo working directory: git checkout -- | remove untracked file: git clean -f 
step 10: push changes to remote repo 

// USING GIT EVERYDAY
- fetch from remote server every single day so you would know what changed 
- before merging, or committing, make it a habit to use git diff to double check differences 

important mention: press q to quit git log, this is very annoying 

// LESSON X.5 - The file will have its original line endings in your working directory. warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Gemfile. | you'll most likely encounter this when using node module, to prevent endless warnings type the line below
git config --global core.safecrlf false` }

funLambda(5) #calling lambda function that was created, it is called like a regular function

#LESSON 4.37 - ARRAYS | there's no array in python, it's called list and it's the equivalent of vector in c++
#in c++ calling the var name of the array means you're referring to the first element thus you cannot change every value it holds on the way you declare them but in python it is somehow possible
arr = [1,2,3] 
#array method, there's a lot but here's a few, just check the documentation
arr.append(4) #add at the end of the list
arr.pop() #remove the last, it could also be pop(0) to remove the first element
print(arr[0]) #dereferencing the first element of the list

#LESSON 4.38 - CLASS 
#python's class is weird, it does not have data members, you declare data members outside the class and it just contains functions, 
#all functions are considered as static method for other languages such as c++ and java since you can call them even without creating an object

class SampleClass:
#syntax for constructor, weird right?
def __init__(self,firstName,lastName,age):#self is the equivalent of 'this' and it is required as parameter when using the functionality of 'this'
    self.firstName = firstName
    self.lastName = lastName
    self.age = age
def print(self): #yeah we still need to pass self here since we would be using it
    print("Hello, " + self.firstName)

#obj = constructor | again, the syntax is really weird compared to c++ and java
obj = SampleClass("Renz","Carillo",19)
print(obj.age) #we're accessing the attribute 'age'
#SampleClass.print(obj) #here we're accessing it like it's a static method in c++

#LESSON 4.39 - INHERITANCE 
class DerivedClass (SampleClass): #this is the syntax for inheritance
pass

#LESSON 4.39A - SUPER KEYWORD
#in java, super can be used to call the base's constructor,overriden method, or instance variable/data members, but in python only calling of base constructor is possible
class DerivedClass1 (SampleClass):
def __init__ (self):
    print("Derived class has this and the one below")
    super().__init__("Markagne","Lazo",11) #in here we called the constructor of the base class using super

obj1 = DerivedClass1()
print(obj1.age)

#LESSON 4.40 - ITERATORS
#iterator is used for container that could be counted, e.g. array,string(technically it is an array of char),vector,stack,deque,etc. | it is like a pointer, when calling the array
nums = [1,2,3] #this is a list, which is a container, this is iterable
it = nums.__iter__() #another syntax for assigning this as an iterator is - it = iter(nums)
print(next(it)) #next(iterator) is the syntax for calling the next element in the array 

#creating your own iterator object class
class MyClass:
def __init__ (self,start,end): #initializing the constructor
    self.start = start
    self.end = end
def __iter__ (self): #this is required when creating ur own iterator
    return self
def __next__ (self): #this is also required
    value = self.start
    self.start += 1
    return value

obj = MyClass(1,10)
print(obj.__next__())

#LESSON 4.41 - SCOPE | this is super ez but im gonna include it anyways since it's part of the learning path
y = 200 #this is a global variable, it could be used at any functions
def func():
x = 100 #this is a local variable, its lifetime ends when the function ends, its scope is only inside this function

#LESSON 4.42 - MODULE | this is a collection of functions in a different file, a collection of module is library
import calcu #this is the equivalent of include <file.h> in c++
#import calcu as alias | 'as alias' means you could call this module as alias
#from calcu import * | do this if you dont want to call the import name everytime, import name in this instance is calcu
#syntax : (name of import).(class name).(method)
calcu.Calcu.add(5,10)
calcu.outsideClassFunction() #this is a function outside the class thus no need to call the class name

#LESSON 4.43 - DATES MODULE | this is a basic module to learn to access datetime
import datetime as dt
obj = dt.date(2021,5,8) #we are assigning this value to the constructor date class
print(obj.year) #access the year
print(obj.month) #access the month
print(obj.day) #access the day
objToday = dt.date.today() #we are assigning this variable to the method today()
print(objToday)
objTime = dt.time(1,2,3,4)
#there are a lot into this just look at the documentation

#LESSON 4.44 - MATH MODULE | basic collection of functions/method for math 
import math 
a = min(1,10) #find the minimum between the given set of number
b = max(10, 20) #opposite of min
c = pow(1,5) #power, seriously i dont need to explain this
d = math.sqrt(100)
#just look at the documentation for additional fucntions

#LESSON 4.45 - JSON MODULE | i dont think id be needing this soon since this requires javascript and probably only used for web development

#LESSON 4.46 - REGEX | Regular Expression, this is the equivalent of ctrl+f in an ide, it is used to find
# ^ - start
# $ - end
# \s - whitespace
# \S - non whitespace
# [abc] - look at the set that has matching letter
# [^abc] - look at the set that is not matching the letter
# . - any character
# * - match one character 0+ time
# + - match one character 1+ time
# ? - non greedy
import re as regex #re is the name of the module regex
sampleString = "my email is renzcarillo32@gmail.com"

#this would all find the matching keyword you specify
result0 = regex.findall("em", sampleString)
if result0:
print(result0)
#this would search for all matching the keyword 'my email'
result = regex.search("^my.^email$", sampleString)
if result: #reminder: anything with a value is true
print("yeah, there's a match")

#this would look at what position does the indicated pattern is from
result1 = regex.search("\s", sampleString)
if result1:
print("first whitespace is located at position: " , result1.start()) #with (,) comma inside print, you explicitly convert int to str so it is much better to use than '+'

#since i specified whitespace, it would split every whitespace in the text sampleString
result2 = regex.split("\s", sampleString)
if result2:
print(result2)

#substitute the indicated pattern with the one you'd like
result3 = regex.sub("s",".",sampleString)
if result3: 
print(result3)

#LESSON 4.47 - PIP | Package manager for python packages and modules, used to install packages
#commands for command line for pip
#pip install pip - this is one time | install pip
#pip --version - check the version of pip
#pip install camelcase - download the 'camelcase' package | you can now use this package on python
#pip uninstall camelcase - uninstall the package 
#pip list -list the packages of pip
import camelcase as cc
c = cc.CamelCase()
txt = "capitalize the first letter of each word"
print(c.hump(txt)) #this method capitalizes the first letter of each word
#you could find more packages and documentation of each package at 'pypi.org'

#LESSON 4.48 - TRY EXCEPT | do this, if error do this
try: #do this
inp = int(input())
#except: | this is not a good practice since it is too broad in every error this would appear, it is better to be specific at error
except ZeroDivisionError as zd: #if this error occured
print(zd)
except: #this is like else if
print("wrong input")
else: #else is if all except wasn't executed
print("yo, it was a success")
finally: #this always execute
print("finally is always present")

#LESSON 4.49 - INPUT | equivalent of std::cin in c++
user = input("Enter your username")
print("Hello ", user)

#LESSON 4.50 - STRING FORMAT | this is to format the string text that is out of your control e.g. they're in database
                                    #0 - element no. | : | .3f - make it decimal to to 3 points
text001 = "here is a sample string no. {0:.3f}" #'{}' is the placeholder used for string formatting
number = 1
print(text001.format(number))
                                #you could also leave '{}' but it is not a good practice
text001 = "here is a sample string no. {} and not {1}"
number = 1
secondNumber = 2

text002 = "print text like this {carname}"
print(text002.format(carname = "Ford")) #you could also define the formatted string inside the argument

#LESSON 5.51 - VARIABLES 
a = 10 #variables cannot be declared in python, only initialized

#LESSON 5.54 - UNPACKING VARIABLES | other programming languages has an equivalent of this one
a,b,c = 1,2,3 #here is a way
d = e = f = 5 #another weird way (im not sure if this is possible in c++ and java)
arrArrArr = [1,2,3,4,5]
g,h,i,j,k = arrArrArr #assigning the values  of arrArrArr to g,h,i,j,k, it's like doing g = arrArrArr[0], h = arrArrArr[1], etc.

#LESSON 5.55 - OUTPUT | equivalent to std::cout << in c++ and System.out.println() in java, but srsly why is this only covered later on the course?
print("just print this")

#LESSON 5.56 - GLOBAL VARIABLES | this is a little feature that differs with c++ since reassigning and initializing has the same syntax in python
x = 10
y = 5
def funcfuncfunc():
global x #we are calling the global variable x
x = 50 #if we do this are we assigning or initializing? we're initializing thus a variable x for global and local scope is created, it is not reassigned and this two x are two different x
#here is an example when the problem arises
#y += 1 #this would produce an error because the python thought you are initializing | this is equal to y = y+1, its only good for reassigning
print(x)

#LESSON 6.58 - STRING
#example of multiline string, use 3 """
strString = """ a b c d
e f g h """ 
string0001 = "access it like this"
print(string0001[0]) #the way you access it is the same with c++ and java

#LESSON 6.58A - USE OF IN AND NOT IN | it is used if an element is inside the container, it returns true or false
if "a" in string0001:
print("a is in stringVar")
if "x" not in string0001:
print("x is not in stringVar")

#LESSON 6.59 - SLICING STRINGS
sampleStringString = "hello hello world"
print(sampleStringString[2:8]) #start the slicing at element 2 which is 'l' and end it with element 8 which is 'l'
print(sampleStringString[:3]) #it could be like this and vice versa, if like this it starts with 'h' and ends with 'l'

#LESSON 6.60 - STRING METHODS
stringtring = "abdDsF"
print(stringtring.upper()) #this means capitalize every letter
print(stringtring.lower()) #lower all of the capital letters
#just look at the documentation for more different methods

#LESSON 6.63 - ESCAPE CHARACTERS
#this is used to use illegal characters inside string literals
print("here is an example use of escape \n character \" ") #use backslash followed by whatever character you want

#LESSON 7.67 - LIST |it is the most flexible among dictionary,set,and tuple, it's like vector in c++ except vector cant hold both numerical and alpha characters at the same time, it is ordered ang changeable
listSample = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

#this is how to access a list
print(listSample[0]) #access first index like an array
print(listSample[-1]) #access last index of the list

#access specific part of the list only
print(listSample[1:3]) #this means start the access at the second index element and end it with the 4th index element

#you could change all items in the list at once, which is impossible to do at c++ and java, you could only select specific part
listSample = [6,5,4,3,2,1] #you are changing the whole list, this is impossible in c++ and java
listSample[1:3] = [20,30,50] #you are changing the 2nd index element up to 4th index element, also impossible in c++ and java

#insert item at list (just like vector)
listSample.insert(0,1231231)

#add items at the end (just like in vector)
listSample.append(9000)

#combine a list into another list
combineThisList = [69,79,89]
combineThisTuple = (70000,80000,60000)
listSample.extend(combineThisList) #congrats, you just combined these two lists
listSample.extend(combineThisTuple) #you could even combine different collections/container
#or you could do this
listSample3 = listSample + combineThisList #in c++ an overloaded operator for '+' shall be used 

#delete,pop,remove,clear | delete and pop are basically the same with different syntax
listSample.remove(70000) #we have removed the 70000 from the list
listSample.pop(0) #we have removed the first index element, leaving the argument blank would mean remove the last item of the list
del listSample[0] #remove the first index element, 'del listSample' means deleting all of the content of the list or the list itself?
listSample.clear() #we removed the content of the list but the list is still there

#looping through list, default range based for loop is the best practice
loopThisList = ["Facebook","YouTube","Google","Instagram"]
for i in loopThisList: #best practice to loop a colleciton/container
print(i)

for i in range(len(loopThisList)): #another weird way to loop
print(loopThisList[i])

i = 0
while i < len(loopThisList): #just a regular while loop
print(loopThisList[i])
i = i + 1

[print(x) for x in loopThisList] #very weird way to loop but it is a one liner, it is also called as list comprehension

#LESSON 7.72 - LIST COMPREHENSION | this is a one liner for loop
listCompre = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
[print(x) for x in listCompre] #syntax: content for var in listToLoop | you could also do double for loop just add another for var in listToLoop

#this is the equivalent of the code above
listCompre = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
for x in listCompre:
print(x)

#LESSON 7.73 - SORTING LIST
print(listCompre.sort()) #sort them from smallest to biggest
print(listCompre.reverse()) #reverse the order
print(listCompre.sort(reverse = True)) #start from biggest to smallest

#copying list
myCopyList = listCompre.copy() #use the method .copy() to copy and assign list into myCopyList

#LESSON 8.78 - TUPLES | this is basically a list but you cannot modify the values
sampleTuple = ("a","b","c") #the syntax for tuple uses '()' parentheses

#this is how to access a tuple
print(sampleTuple[0]) #access first index like an array
print(sampleTuple[-1]) #access last index of the tuple

#access specific part of the list only
print(sampleTuple[1:3]) #this means start the access at the second index element and end it with the 4th index element

#adding from tuple | this is more of a hack, we first convert it into list then convert it into tuple
convertList = list(sampleTuple)
convertList.append("d") #here i have added a d, i was able to add since this is currently a list
sampleTuple = tuple(convertList) #i have converted it back to tuple, now the collection cannot be modified again

#removing from tuple | just the same with adding
convertList = list(sampleTuple)
convertList.append("d") #here i have added a d, i was able to remove since this is currently a list
sampleTuple = tuple(convertList) #i have converted it back to tuple, now the collection cannot be modified again

#deleting tuple, just the same with deleting list
del sampleTuple

#LESSON 8.81 - UNPACKING TUPLES | its like a dictionary in some way
unpackTuple = ("green","blue","yellow") #here we are creating a tuple
(var1,var2,var3) = unpackTuple #here we are saying var1 = "green", var2 ="blue", var3 = "yellow"
print(var1)

#looping tuples, just the same as looping list
loopThisTuple = ["Facebook","YouTube","Google","Instagram"]
for i in loopThisTuple: #best practice to loop a colleciton/container
print(i)

for i in range(len(loopThisTuple)): #another weird way to loop
print(loopThisTuple[i])

i = 0
while i < len(loopThisTuple): #just a regular while loop
print(loopThisTuple[i])
i = i + 1

#joining tuples, everything is actually just the same with list why am i still doing this
tuples1 = (1,2,3)
tuples2 = ("a","b")
tuples3 = tuples1 + tuples2 #this uses overloaded operator on c++
print(tuples3)
tuples4 = tuples1 * 3 #yeah you could even multiply the content of tuples 1
print(tuples4)

#tuple methods | it has two methods which is count() and index(), a list has alot more
tupleTuple = (1,2,3,5423,23,2353461,4523,536,54,36,34,1345,23)
tupleCount = tupleTuple.count(23) #it counts how many '23' are there in this tuple
tupleIndex = tupleTuple.index(23) #it returns what is the index value of the argument '23'
print(tupleCount)
print(tupleIndex)

#LESSON 9.86 - SETS | the content must be unique only and it is ordered(for numbers only), the numerical characters are automatically ordered while alpha characters aren't, it is also unindexed
sampleSet = {4,2,3,1} #its syntax is like array in c++ and java but it's not and the difference are huge

#access set items, you cannot access it like the way you access list and tuple, you can only access it through for loop using in
for x in sampleSet:
print(x)

#modify set items
sampleSet.add(5) #obviously add a value
addThisSet = {"a","b","c"}
sampleSet.update(addThisSet) #combine two sets, or any other collections such as list,dictionary,tuple

#to remove an item you can use discard or remove
sampleSet.remove(5) #we removed the value of 5 in this set
sampleSet.discard("a") #idk whats the purpose of putting two methods that does the exact same thing
sampleSet.pop() #we are removing the last value index element, this isnt a good idea since set is automatically organized thus we do not know what is getting removed
sampleSet.clear() #remove all of the contents
del sampleSet #completely remove this set
sampleSet = {1,2,3,4}
sampleSet2nd = {5,6,7,8}
sampleSet3rd = sampleSet.union(sampleSet2nd) #combine sampleSet and sampleSet2nd | this is the same with update or idk
#just look at the documentation for more methods

#LESSON 10.94 - DICTIONARY | this is a collection of key value pairs
sampleDictionary = {
#key   : value
"var1" : "abc",
"var2": 123,
"var3": "efg"
}

#access dictionary
print(sampleDictionary["var1"]) #this would print abc, this is the best practice
print(sampleDictionary.get("var1")) #equivalent of the syntax above

#adding item to the dictionary
sampleDictionary["var4"] = "asdgfasdf" #syntax for adding item

#printing values and key:value pair
print(sampleDictionary) #in here we are only printing the values
print(sampleDictionary.keys()) #we are printing the keys with its value pair too!
print(sampleDictionary.items()) #idk really what this does but it seems to convert everything into an item of each on their own including the keys

#modifying dictionary
sampleDictionary["var4"] = 123 #here i have modified the content of var4
sampleDictionary.update(var4 = 321) #it could be like this but this is honestly weird, just use the one above
sampleDictionary.pop("var4") #remove a pair, input the key as an argument
sampleDictionary.popitem() #remove the last pair
sampleDictionary.clear() #clear all of the contents
del sampleDictionary #delete the existence of this sampleDictionary

#looping dictionary
sampleDictionary = {"var1": 123, "var2": "abc", "var3": 321 }

#this would only print the keys
for x in sampleDictionary: #you could do 'in sampleDictionary.keys() and this would do the same thing
print(x)

for x in sampleDictionary.values(): #this would print the values
print(x)

for x,y in sampleDictionary.items(): #this would print both the keys and values
print(x,y)

referenceDictionary = sampleDictionary #this is the syntax for referencing, every changes made in referenceDictionary would affect the sampleDictionary
copyDictionary = sampleDictionary.copy() #this would copy the values of sample Dictionary
copyDictionaryAgain = dict(sampleDictionary) #this would do the same

print(copyDictionaryAgain)

#nested dictionary
progLanguages = {
"java" : {
    "difficulty" : "medium",
    "oop" : True
},
"c++" : {
    "difficulty" : "hard",
    "oop" : True
},
"python" : {
    "difficulty" : "easy",

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#LESSON S.1 - DUNDER METHODS | special methods in class
class SampleDunderClass:
def __init__(self): #constructor
    self.x = x
def __repr__(self): ##this is displayed to the end user when an object of this class is called but the display is overriden when u use __str__, this is meant for developers
    return "SampleDunderClass({})".format(self.x)
def __str__(self): #this is displayed to the end user when an object of this class is called
    return "The x of SampleDunderClass is {}".format(self.x)
def __add__(self,other): #this is the equivalent of 'class operator+()'/overloaded operator in c++
    return self.x + other.x


#LESSON S.2 - DECORATORS | modify the functionality of a function without changing the code, only usede when passing a function as argument
def outsideFunc(func):
def insideFunc(): #yes, function inside a function is possible in python but not in c++ and java
    print("Executing Inside Function")
    func()
    print("End Inside Function")
return insideFunc #it's returning the memory address of insideFunc

#instead of doing this thing below we could just write it with decorators --------------------------
#def printer():
#    print("Hello World")

#display = outsideFunc(printer) #this is equivalent to writing display = insideFunc, now if we want to call the inside func we could write this as outsideFunc(printer)()
#display() #this is equivalent to writing outsideFunc(printer)()
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@outsideFunc #this is equivalent to writing outsideFunc(printer), we are like passing printer to outsideFunc
def printer():
print("Hello World")

printer() #we could just do this instead, it is equivalent to outsideFunc(printer)(), since it has a decorator it's like we're calling it's decorator function and passing this function as an argument

#LESSON S.3 - EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT even functions, functions are first class objects which could be pass around like a variable
def funcFunc():
return 5
def funcFunc000(functionPass):
return functionPass() + 5 #since functionPass is a reference to funcFunc we must add '()' parentheses | if you cannot understand read the text below first | syntax for reference is object = object1, in c++ it is int& object = object1
print(funcFunc000(funcFunc)) #here because we have written functionPass = funcFunc, functionPass becomes a reference to function funcFunc, if we wanted to grab it by value then we must do functionPass = funcFunc()

#LESSON S.4 - ANY AND ALL | any - if one of the iterable is true then it returns true, if empty return false | all - every iterable must be true or empty to return true
any(["abc",False,1]) #this would return true since it has two values that is true
all({}) #it has no value so it must be true
boolVar = any([x == "a" for x in "rango"]) #example usage of any in a list comprehension
print(boolVar)

//LESSON 2.4 - IDENTIFIER
int //DATATYPE
a //IDENTIFIER

//THIS COULD ALSO BE TYPED IN A SINGLE LINE
//int a = 1;

//ASSIGNMENT IS NOT ALLOWED IN GLOBAL, NOTHING IS EXECUTED ON GLOBAL THUS INITIALIZATION ARE THE ONLY ONES ALLOWED
/*int a;
a = 5*/

//LESSON 2.5 - DEFINING VARIABLES
//int bbbbb; //DECLARATION
int b = 2; //INITIALIZATION

//LESSON 2.6 - POINTERS
//IT IS BEST PRACTICE TO ADD p AT THE FRONT OF THE NAME OF POINTER VARIABLE e.g. pVariable
int* c = &b; //c NOW HOLDS THE MEMORY ADDRESS OF b

//THIS COULD ALSO BE TYPED AS:
/* 
int* c;
c = &b; //YOU DON'T HAVE TO TYPE THE POINTER OPERATOR AGAIN AT INITIALIZATION
*/

//*c = 3; //THE POINTER HAS BEEN DEREFERENCED AND NOW THE VALUE OF c AND b IS 3, NO ASSIGNMENT IS ALLOWED ON GLOBAL SCOPE

//LESSON 2.7 - REFERENCES
//YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME MEMORY ADDRESS WITH REFERENCE
int d = 4;
int& e = d; //e IS NOW AN ALIAS OF D, EVERY CHANGE YOU MADE ON e WOULD ALSO OCCUR TO d

//LESSON 2.8 - PRIMITIVE ARRAYS
//ARRAY COULD BE ANY DATA TYPE, IT COULD BE int, float, double, char, etc.

    f = f + 1; //IT WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT INDEX OF ARRAY, THIS f POINTER NOW POINTS TO 2ND INDEX
    f = f + 2; //THIS f POINTER NOW POINTS TO THE 3RD INDEX
    *(f + 3) = 5; //WE ARE GETTING THE ADDRES OF 4TH INDEX THEN DEREFERENCING IT THUS ASSIGNING THE 4TH INDEX A VALUE OF 5
}
//LESSON 2.9 - PRIMITIVE STRING

CREATE DATABASE movies; -- make sure to refresh navigator pane for this new schema/database to appear
-- *note: you could do these things easily with wizard

-- LESSON 3.2 - CREATING TABLE
-- (PK) PRIMARY KEY - UNIQUE TO EACH RECORDS
-- (NN) NOT NULL - CANNOT CONTAIN NULL VALUES
-- (UQ) UNIQUE - EACH ROW MUST HAVE A UNIQUE VALUE IN THIS COLUMN
-- (B) BINARY - COLUMN WILL CONTAIN BINARY DATA
-- (UN) UNSIGNED - COLUMN CANNOT CONTAIN ANY NEGATIVE NUMBERS
-- (ZF) ZERO FILL - VALUES WILL BE PADDED TO MAXIMUM COLUMN SIZE WITH ZEROES WHEN DISPLAYED
-- (AI) AUTO INCREMENT - WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE AN UNUSED VALUE FOR THIS COLUMN
-- (G)  GENERATED - COLUMN VALUE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BASED ON SUPPLIED EXPRESSION

CREATE TABLE movies_basic -- CREATE TABLE table_name
(id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, -- these are the keywords from above
title VARCHAR(100), -- field_name datatype(n)
genre VARCHAR(20),

-- modifying table
ALTER TABLE movies_basic -- we're saying we're about to modify a table
ADD COLUMN box_office_gross FLOAT, -- add a new field with float as a datatype
RENAME COLUMN critics_rating to critic_rating, -- renaming field_name
CHANGE COLUMN director director VARCHAR(50); -- changing the datatype of a field

-- LESSON 3.3 - PRIMARY KEYS AND FOREIGN KEYS
-- PRIMARY KEYS - UNIQUE TO EACH COLUMN VALUES
-- FOREIGN KEYS - PRIMARY KEYS IN ANOTHER TABLE THAT IS LINKED TO THE CURRENT TABLE

-- LESSON 3.4 - IMPORTING DATA FROM EXCEL
-- NAVIGATOR -> MOVIES(TABLE) -> MOVIES_BASIC(TABLE) -> RIGHT-CLICK, THEN TABLE DATA IMPORT WIZARD -> SELECT CORRECT FILE THEN KEEP ON CLICKING NEXT
SELECT * FROM movies.movies_basic; -- have a look at newly imported data

-- CHALLENGE: CREATE NEW NORMALIZED TABLES, SIMILAR DATA TO MOVIES_BASIC BUT IN FIVE TABLES, EACH TABLES WILL HAVE ONE PRIMARY AND POSSIBLY FOREIGN KEYS, POPULATE EACH TABLE WITH THE DATASETS FROM THE EXERCISE FILES

-- LESSON 4.1 - SELECT - this just means return this that we're selecting, we've already learned this at sql programming go check it out
SELECT genre, title -- SELECT field_name
FROM movies.movies_basic; -- FROM main_table.sub_table

-- LESSON 4.2 - REFINE SELECT QUERIES
-- selecting specific no. of rows
SELECT *

LIMIT 5; -- only select 5 rows(records) of data

SELECT *
FROM movies.movies_basic
LIMIT 5, 10; -- start with 5th row end with 10th row | somehow works like offset in sql programming

-- selecting unique values only

-- organizing by ascending or descending order
SELECT *

-- organizing the 1st specified field first then organize the 2nd specified field
SELECT * FROM movies_basic ORDER BY genre, release_year; -- i'm just gonna format it this way so our code wouldn't be too long

-- LESSON 4.3 - USING WHERE CLAUSE - it is somehow like an if statement for sql
SELECT * FROM movies_basic
WHERE id >= 10; -- look at your programming language cheatcode to see more logical operators, there are plenty of them, also you could AND, OR, etc. you know them already

-- using like clause to find matching words
SELECT * FROM movies_basic
WHERE genre LIKE "Children"; -- you could also use LIKE "c%" to match everything that starts with letter c | % is pretty much like _ | != is equal to <>

-- using functions in where clause, again, it functions just like an if statement in other programming languages

-- if you have a database that is huge, delete is not a good idea, you should use truncate, by using truncate and let's say you remove rows 1-4, truncate would start the autoincrement counting again at 1 unlike delete where if you remove rows 1-4 the 1st value in the table would be 5
